# Xmas2021-JuliaLabs-PCB-Challenge

This is a board developed for Julialabs PCB Challenge 2021 with a Christmas theme.

It just need a 3V CR1220 batter cell power to automatically start over with a predefined (by software) LED sequences that highlights the main eight star corners, alternating the 4 inside corners (blue LEDs) with 4 outside corners (White LEDs), taking full circle clockwise and counterclockwise blinking, and some all on and all off LEDs between this sequences.

The software was developed using PlatformIO for VSCode IDE using the little Attiny85 SMD mounting and can be found at this github repository (with another project files).

It was used SOIC packages and easy manual soldering SMD components for an equally easy DIY experience on mounting.

LEDs must be placed with side (turned do same directions) or, if possible with a bottom orientation (that could be possible with some turnaround at soldering time) taking the better from translucid parts of the board.

All the process was lived streamed at [Twitch](twitch.tv/vilelalabs) and some of this development will be highlighted to [Youtube](http://youtube.com/vilelalabs) later.
